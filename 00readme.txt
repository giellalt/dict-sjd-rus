01 - this is the list of sjdoahpa lemmata that kindly have been corrected
 by native speaker A.A.Antonova via Elli
 
 Micha: possible problems in the list 01:
 -too many multi-word-expressions for Kildin head-words (e.g. non-lexicalized нызан олма, вӣллькесь роавас ча̄дзь)?
 -also perhaps too many multi-word-expressions for Russian translations?
 -some spelling variants could be unified (e.g. та̄ррьмъя : та̄ррмъя, е̄ммьнэ : е̄ммьне), but note that these are inconsistencies (mistakes?) in spelling which have nothing to do with the two competing orthographic variants! 
 -some Kildin adjectives are inconsequently translated with either the Russian attributive or predicative adjective (perhaps, the translation should always include both forms tagged as прилаг.опред. and прилаг.сказ. [or the like] respectively?)
 -some Kildin verbs are inconsequently translated with either the Russian perfective or imperfective verb (perhaps, the translation should always include both forms tagged as глаг.несв. and глаг.св. [or the like] respectively?)
 -we have to deal consistently with the meaning groups (in case of multiple translations)
